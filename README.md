#JSON BASICS 
## JSON DEFINITION 
Javascript Object Notation 
--> also known as a **dicitonary**

However, confusingly an object in JS is the Data Type
for both Lists (Arrays) and Dictionaries (Hash)

## Create a JSON file
## Make POST Request with JSON (TASK)
You need:
    - a path 
    - json 
    - headers 
    
Make a small programme that requests 3 postcodes and returns something like 
'''
   > 1 - Postcode: xyzpto with nhs location at: xyx
   > 2 - Postcode: xyzpto2 with nhs location at: xyx
   > 3 - (....)
'''
